    <h3> How to make them.</h3>
        <p> Mix together the ground almonds and icing sugar. Stiffly whip the egg whites and mix carefully with the almund sugar mixture. With a teaspoon, put small dollops of dough on a baking sheet covered with backing paper, and bake at 180 degrees C for about 15 minutes, or until the cookies begin to take on a golden colour. Remove the cookies from the baking sheet with a spatula while still hot. Allow  to cool completly before adding the creme. 
        
    <p><b>Creme filling:</b> <br>
    Put the water a sugar into a soucepan and cook until the sugar is melted and a thin syrup has formed. Remove from the heat and cool. Beat the egg yolks and slowly pour the cooled syrup into them, sterring constantly. Add the softened butter and mix well. Add cocoa and instant coffee powder (if using). Put in the refrigerator to cool <br>
    Spread the cooled creme on the underside of each cookie, forming a small mound in the center. Put in the refrigerator. The creme needs to be cold and stiff before proceeding on to the next step.</p> 
    
    <p><b>Coating:</b><br>
    Melt the chocolate in a bowl over boiling water. Cool to about 40 degrees C (use a candy thermometer). Dip the covered-covered part of the cookies in melted chocolate, to coat. 
    <br><br><un> 
    <li> These cookies should be stored frozen.</li>
    <li> Try different kinds of creme filling - any recipe for buttercream icing can be used.</li>      </un></p>

        <h4> Serves 2</h4> 
        <img src="Pics/duckbreast.jpg" alt="duck breast" title="Duck breast with Blackcurrent suace." hieght="600" width="400">
            <details>Duck with orange or cherries is such a classic, but there is no reason why you cant  pair it with other fruit or vegatables, such as rhubarb, gooseberries, or, as here blackcurrents - anythin with a little acidity to cut  through the meat's rechness. Baby potatoes and chopped greens would make ideal accompnimaents.</details>
    <h4> What you will need.</h4>
        <ul>
        <li> 2 duck breasts, skin on</li>
        <li> Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li></ul>
        <h4> For the sauce</h4>
        <ul> <li> 150ml dry red wine</li>
        <li> 2 garlic cloves, skin on and lightly crushed</li>
        <li> A few thyme sprigs</li>
        <li> 150ml duck or chicken stock</li>
        <li> 3 tbsp blackcurrent or conserve</li>
        <li> 25g butter, cut in to cubes</li></ul>
        
        <h3> How to make this.</h3>
    <ol> <p><li start= "1"> Preheat the oven to 180 degreese <b>C</b>/gas 4.</li></p>
        
        <p><li start="2"> Score the skin of the duck in a crisscross pattern, then rub with salt and pepper. Place them skin side down on a dry hob proof roasting tray and cook over a very low heat to render most of the fat. This may take 15-20 minutes.</li></p>
        
        <p><li start="3"> Meanwhile, make the sauce. Place the red wine ina pan with the garlic and thyme and boil for 7-8 minuets until reduced by half. Pour in the stock and reduce again by half. Stir the blackcurrent jam into the sauce and add a few knobs of butter to give it a shine. Tast and adjust seasoning, the strain through a fine sieve and disgard the solids. </li></p>
        
        <p><li start="4"> Turn up the heat under the duck breasts and fry for about 5 minutes until the skin is crisp. turn them over and fry on the other side for 1-2 minutes untill cooked through. Place the tray in the oven for 8-10 minutes until the duck is slightly springy when pressed.</li></p>
        
        <p><li start="5"> Rest the duck breasts on a warm plate for 5 minutes, then cut into slices on the diagonal. Place on warmed serving plates. Spoon over the blackcurrent suace and serve. </li></p>
        
        <b><mark> How to minimise fattiness in the duck meat.</mark></b> <details>Normally, meat should be added to a hot pan and sizzle the moment it goes in. Duck breast, however, should be added to a cold pan and slowly brought up to temprature. This is becuase the breast is very fatty and needs time for the fat to run out into the pan, or render. If you added the breast to a hot pan, it woild seal the fat in.</details> </ol></article></div>
